TLDR:
This is where hopes and dreams go to live until I have time to work on them

Longer Version:
Very minimal foundations for what I felt could have real-world application with some tweaks, or abstract ideas that could be built on to make useful tools
This folder is a back log of projects I would like to work on when I have the time but are not a current priority
